'''
. Number Range Display System (if-elif with loops)*
A number analysis tool processes two input values and displays numbers between them 
based on their relationship.

* If the first number is less than the second, display numbers in ascending order
* If the first number is greater than the second, display numbers in descending order
* If both numbers are equal, display "Both numbers are same"

Write a program using *if-elif-else and loops* to implement this logic.

Input: 5, 10
Output: 5 6 7 8 9 10

Input: 10, 5
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5

Input: 7, 7
Output: Both numbers are same'''

a,b = map(int,input("Enter any two numbers : ").split())

if a > b:
    for i in range(a,b-1,-1):
        print(i, end = " ")
elif b > a:
    for i in range(a,b+1,1):
        print(i, end = " ")
else:
    print("Both numbers are same")
